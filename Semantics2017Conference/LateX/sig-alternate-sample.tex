\begin{abstract}
Several IoT ontologies were developed to promote semantic interoperability of IoT solutions. The most notable ontology, the W3C Semantic Sensor Network (SSN), is considered an ontological foundation for diverse IoT initiatives, as OpenIoT. With characteristics similar to SSN, the ETSI Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology emphasizes the needs of smart home solutions. Some IoT solutions rely on platform-specific ontologies and their integration requires mechanisms to align these ontologies. In this paper we describe the initial steps towards an alignment between SSN and SAREF, proposing an initial specification of the translation mappings among the main elements of the ontologies, i.e. classes, object properties and data properties. The alignment will be used in a semantic translation process leveraging the INTER-IoT project. An initial evaluation of the translation demonstrates how a wind sensor (Vaisala WM30), an example provided by the W3C, is translated from SSN to SAREF.

\section{Introduction}
- Problem context, Goal/Requirement:\\
- Proposal:\\
- Validation:\\ 
- Paper structure:\\ 
Over the last years a number of IoT ontologies were proposed to achieve semantic interoperability of sensors in integrated IoT solutions. In this context, the W3C Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) is considered an ontological basis for the IoT, covering any application of sensors, being used as foundation by several initiatives (e.g. OpenIoT). Recently, the ETSI Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology was developed, targeting smart home solutions. It is based on several “assets”, i.e. syntactic standards, proprietary data models and other ontologies, as W3C SSN. To enable integration among two IoT platforms, where one platform relies on SSN and the other relies on SAREF, an ontology alignment mechanism between SSN and SAREF is required. In this paper we describe the initial steps towards bi-directional semantic translation rules between SSN and SAREF. The approach makes use of ontology engineering to specify these translations. This specification will be further configured and deployed in the Inter Platform Semantic Mediator (IPSM) of the INTER-IoT project. These initial steps include the bi-directional mappings among the main elements of the ontologies, i.e. classes, object properties and data properties. An initial evaluation of the translation is presented, demonstrating how the wind sensor WM30, an example provided by the W3C, is translated from SSN to SAREF.

\section{BACKGROUND}

\subsection{INTER-IoT semantic mediator}
The H2020 project Interoperability of Heterogeneous IoT Platforms (INTER-IoT) [1, 2] is currently developing the  Inter-Platform Semantic Mediator (IPSM) tool. The following tasks are executed as part of the IPSM design and implementationto:  (2) develop a central modular ontology, consisting of a core IoT ontology and domain specific modules, (3) preparealignments between ontologies of communicating artefacts and the central ontology,  (4) use the alignments for translations, and (5) establish a multi-channel (1-1, 1-many, many-1) communication architecture that will facilitate translations in all needed contexts. While complete ontologies are used to “build semantic understanding”, only conversation-specific alignments are stored and used for actual translations. Figure \ref{fig:IPSM} illustrates IPSM architecture. Ontology alignments and translation channels can be managed and ontology reconciliation  through the REST Manager.

Ontology alignment – semantic translations [3]

Semantic translation supported by IPSM uses ontology alignments that are specified in a dedicated format….. 


\subsection{W3C Semantic Sensor Network}
The SSN ontology is an ontology developed by W3C and the last version was published in 2011 in the official URL (https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/ssnx/ssn). It provides a framework to describe sensors, devices, observations and related concepts, enabling reasoning either about individual sensors as well as about the connection of a set of sensors. 

A \textit{Sensing Device} is a sensor that reports measurements and observations of real world phenomena. A sensor is different in nature from other types of devices, e.g. actuators, because of its event-based behavior, which requires temporal relationships. SSN enables reasoning about the measurements that can ease the development of advanced applications, for example by reasoning about sensor measurements, considering constraints as power restriction and limited memory. 

The SSN ontology is composed of modules and is grounded in the foundational ontology DOLCE Ultra-Light (DUL). The modules we are covering in this paper are the following:
DUL module: represents the foundational categorization of Designed Artifact, Method, Physical Object, Quality, Region and Situation.  

Skeleton module: represents the most basic concepts regarding sensors, as abstractions of real world phenomena that describe input and output of sensing, properties, observations and features of interest.

System module: represents the system concept as a Physical Object (DUL) composed by other systems (hasSubSystem), which has deployment(s) (hasDeployment), normal operating environment(s) (hasOperatingRange), survival range(s) (hasSurvivalRange) and location(s) relative to other entities (onPlatform).

Process module: Input, Output, Process, hasInput, hasOutput, isProducedBy

Measuring module: SensingDevice, SensorDataSheet, observes

Measuring Capability module: Accuracy, DetectionLimit, Drift, Frequency, Latency, MeasurementCapability, MeasurementProperty, MeasurementRange, Precision, Resolution, ResponseTime, Selectivity, Sensitivity	hasMeasurementCapability, hasMeasurementProperty

Observation module: represents a situation with a discrete time instant or a period assigned to a phenomenon, involving the application of a specified procedure, e.g. a process chain. The result of an observation is an estimate of the value of a property of some feature, allowing observation data using different procedures to be combined unambiguously. 

Device module: device

The W3C SSN Incubator Group created an example of the use of SSN by describing the Vaisala WM30 wind sensor (https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/ssnx/meteo/WM30.html). It describes the measurement capabilities, power supply and operating and survival properties based on the technical specification about the measurement of wind direction and speed. This example was initially reported in [4], which gives a precise description of the WM30 sensor. However, the axioms representing its main definitions and restrictions are different, following the changes in the TBox of SSN over the past years. Bellow we update these main definitions:

\begin{align*}
  \begin{aligned}
	&\node{WM30}{Vaisala\_WM30} \sqsubseteq \node{ssn}{SensingDevice}\\
	&\node{WM30}{Vaisala\_WM30} \sqsubseteq\\
	&\qquad\erestr{\node{ssn}{hasSubSystem}}{\node{WM\_30}{WM30\_WindDirection}}\\
	&\node{WM30}{Vaisala\_WM30} \sqsubseteq\\
	&\qquad\erestr{\node{ssn}{hasSubSystem}}{\node{WM\_30}{WM30\_WindSpeed}}\\	
	&\node{WM30}{Vaisala\_WM30} \sqsubseteq\\
	&\qquad\erestr{\node{ssn}{observes}}{\node{WM\_30}{WM30\_WinDirection}}\\
	&\node{WM30}{Vaisala\_WM30} \sqsubseteq\\
	&\qquad\erestr{\node{ssn}{observes}}{\node{WM\_30}{WM30\_WindSpeed}}\\
  \end{aligned}\\
\end{align*}
These axioms represent the Vaisala WM30 as a Sensing Device (therefore a Device (System) and a Sensor), composed by (has subsystem) WM30 particular sensors for wind direction and wind speed, being able to measure (observes) wind direction (WM30\_WindDirection) and speed (WM30\_WindSpeed). 

\subsection{ETSI Smart Appliances REFerence}
The SAREF ontology [5] is a reference model that facilitates the matching of existing assets, e.g. standards, ontologies, data models and protocols, in the smart appliances domain. 

The SAREF ontology provides building blocks that enables reutilization of different parts of the ontology according to specific requirements. One of these assets is SSN, which inspired the creation of the main elements of SAREF: Device, Sensor, Unit of Measure and Time/Duration. 

A device (e.g. a switch) represents tangible objects designed to accomplish one or more functions in diverse types of locations (e.g. households, buildings). The SAREF ontology offers a lists of basic functions that can be combined towards more complex functions in a single device. For example, a switch offers an actuating function of type “switching on/off”. 

Each function has some associated commands, which can also be picked up as building blocks from a list. For example, the “switching on/off” is associated with the commands “switch on”, “switch off” and “toggle”. Depending on the function(s) it accomplishes, a device can be found in some corresponding states that are also listed as building blocks. 

A Device offers a Service, which  is a representation of a Function to a network that makes the function discoverable, registerable and remotely controllable by other devices in the network. A Service can represent one or more functions. A Service is offered by a device that wants (a certain set of) its function(s) to be discoverable, registerable, remotely controllable by other devices in the network. A Service must specify the device that is offering the service, the function(s) to be represented, and the (input and output) parameters necessary to operate the service. 

A Device in the SAREF ontology is also characterized by an (Energy/Power) Profile that can be used to optimize the energy efficiency in a home or office that are part of a building.


\section{METHODOLOGY}
The development of the bi-directional semantic translations follows a common software engineering approach, considering a specification and an implementation phase during design time. 

Specification: 

Implementation: configuration within IPSM.

This approach enables to (re)use the specification for different strategies of ontology alignments’ implementation, e.g. matching, mapping, and merging. In this paper we present part of the specification, referring to the unidirectional semantic translation from SSN to SAREF.

As first evaluation of this specification, we simulate an unidirectional semantic translation from WM30 ontology, represented as an extension of SSN, to an ontology represented as SAREF. In general, the result from the translations must represent the WM30 wind sensor with SAREF, keeping similar semantics of the original. 

Therefore, the goal of this evaluation is to check the semantic similarity between the original and the final ontologies. Here we used an approach based on competency questions to measure this similarity. A list of competency questions is presented and each question is responded by querying the elements (classes, properties and instances) of both ontologies. The responses are compared to verify whether the semantics is maintained after executing the translation. Intentionally, the competency questions were conceived according to the expressiveness of the SSN WM30 ontology, targeting its main elements, as the different measurement capabilities illustrated in the technical specifications (Figure \ref{fig:WM30specifications}).

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[scale=0.22]{WM30specifications}
\caption{The specification of WM30 wind sensor}
\label{fig:WM30specifications}
\end{figure}

Competency questions: 
\\CQ01. What are the main characteristics of the Vaisala WM30 sensor? 
\\CQ02. What is the composition of this sensor, i.e. what other devices are part of WM30?
\\CQ03. What measurement properties this sensor provides?
\\CQ04. What are the accuracy, delay distance, starting threshold and damping ratio of WMS30 wind direction sensors? \\CQ05. What measurement range constraints differentiate these types of wind direction sensors?
\\CQ06. What are the distance constant, starting threshold and transducer output of wind speed sensors? 
\\CQ07. What are the ranges of accuracy and condition ranges  constraints differentiate these types of wind speed sensors?
\\CQ08. What is the characteristic transfer function of WM30?

\section{SEMANTIC TRANSLATIONS}

\subsection{Mappings: SSN to SAREF}
Mappings between SSN and SAREF were specified through an ontological analysis of their TBox, i.e. concepts and roles definitions (predicates) with logical operations. A study was made on how SSN and SAREF describe the characteristics of sensors, including their capabilities of observation. The mappings follow a logic sequence according to the main elements and similar structures of SSN and SAREF. 

Here we detail only the mappings from SSN to SAREF because of space limitation – the other direction, from SAREF to SSN, will be reported in the future. For each mapping a code snippet is presented, as a pseudocode, to illustrate the creation of the ontology using SAREF. While the main element in SSN is the \textit{Sensing Device}, which is a subclass of \textit{Device} and \textit{Sensor}, in SAREF the main element is \textit{Device}, which can be specialized as a \textit{Sensor} related to \textit{Sensing Function}. 

\subsubsection{M01. ssn:SensingDevice -> saref:Sensor}
The characteristics of \textit{ssn:SensingDevice}, inherited from \textit{ssn:Sensor} and \textit{ssn:System}, is mapped to \textit{saref:Sensor}, which inherits \textit{saref:Device} properties, including the relationship with the \textit{saref:SensingFunction} (\textit{saref:hasFunction}). The code snippet below illustrates this mapping. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pseudocode snippet for M01},label={code:sample}]
IN: {ssn_sensingDevice}  
create saref_sensor = saref:Sensor  

/* Copy all rdfs properties */ 
saref_sensor.rdfs:* = ssn_sensingDevice.rdfs:*
    
create saref_function = saref:SensingFunction  
create saref_hasFunction = saref:hasFunction  
create saref_sensor saref_hasFunction saref_function  

\end{lstlisting}

Figure \ref{fig:SSN_SAREF_SensingDevice_Device} illustrates the elements involved in this mapping. Notice that, indirectly, this mapping also transforms from \textit{ssn:Sensor} to \textit{saref:Sensor}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{SSN_SAREF_SensingDevice_Device}
\caption{Main elements of SSN and SAREF}
\label{fig:SSN_SAREF_SensingDevice_Device}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{M02. ssn:hasSubSystem -> saref:consistsOf}
Once executing M01, the next step is to check the composition relationship of a device, i.e. the components that are part of a device, which are characterized by both SSN and SAREF. In SSN, the object property \textit{ssn:hasSubSystem} relating two \textit{ssn:System} represents this relationship. In SAREF, the object property \textit{saref:consistsOf} plays this role, relating two \textit{saref:Device} in a similar way, both illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:SSN_SAREF_SensingDevice_Device} as a self-relationship. Therefore, when \textit{ssn:hasSubSystem} is used between the \textit{ssn\_sensingDevice} (from M01) and a \textit{ssn:System}, which must be a \textit{ssn:Device} or a \textit{ssn:SensingDevice}, then it is mapped to \textit{saref:consistsOf} object property of the \textit{saref\_sensor} (created in M01). If the device component is a \textit{ssn:SensingDevice}, then a recursive algorithm is used by applying M01 to it. If the device component is a \textit{ssn:Device}, then it is created a \textit{saref:Device}. The code snippet below illustrates this mapping.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pseudocode snippet for M02},label={code:sample}]
IN: {ssn_sensingDevice, saref_sensor}
for each ssn_system in ssn_sensingDevice.ssn:hasSubSystem 
{ 
  create saref_device_component = saref:Device 
  if ssn_system is ssn:SensingDevice then 
  { 
    /* transform saref:Device to saref:Sensor */
    saref_device_component = Map(M01, ssn_system) 
  } 
  else 
  if ssn_system is ssn:Device then 
  { 
    /* Copy all rdfs properties */ 
    saref_device_component.rdfs:* = ssn_system.rdfs:* 
  } 
  create saref_consistsOf = saref:consistsOf 
  create saref_sensor saref_consistsOf saref_device_component 
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{M03. ssn:observes -> saref:measuresProperty}
Once executing M01 and M02, the next step is to map the measurement property which the sensor is able to observe, i.e. the measurement property of a sensor. For example, a wind sensor is able to observe both wind direction and wind speed. Therefore, the \textit{ssn:observes} of a \textit{ssn:SensingDevice} is mapped to \textit{saref:measuresProperty} of a \textit{saref:Device}. These object properties relates to \textit{ssn:Property} and \textit{saref:Property}, respectively. Therefore, this mapping also includes the creation, if not exists, of the \textit{ssn:Property}. At last, this mapping needs to create the relationship back from the \textit{saref:Property} to the \textit{saref:Device} through the object property \textit{saref:isMeasuredByDevice}. The code snippet below illustrates this mapping. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pseudocode snippet for M02},label={code:sample}]
IN: {ssn_sensingDevice, saref_sensor}
for each ssn_property in ssn_sensingDevice.ssn:observes 
{ 
  create saref_property = saref:Property 
  
  saref_property = GetPropertyInSAREF(ssn_property)
    
  /* check if the property already exists */
  if saref_property is null then 
  { 
    /* Copy all rdfs properties */ 
    saref_property.rdfs:* = ssn_property.rdfs:* 
  } 
  create saref_measuresProperty = saref:measuresProperty 
  create saref_sensor saref_measuresProperty saref_property 
  
  create saref_isMeasuredByDevice = saref:isMeasuredByDevice
  create saref_property saref_isMeasuredByDevice saref_sensor
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Evaluation}
As described in the methodology section, an execution of the mappings presented above was simulated having the WM30 wind sensor example (according to SSN) as input. The output of this translation, i.e. the WM30 ontology according to SAREF, in OWL, was produced and made available (\url{https://github.com/jonimoreira/SSN-SAREF}). The answers of the competency questions, listed in methodology section, were produced by navigating and querying (SPARQL) this generated ontology with support of an ontology editor (Protegé and TopBraid Composer). 

For each question, at first we answered the question based on the original ontology (in SSN) and, then, we answered the same question for the generated ontology (SAREF). Second, we compare whether the semantics of the response is similar to each other, ranking this similarity with four possible values: (1) cannot answer; (2) semantics is lost, representing an important gap; (3) semantics is lost, but covers the main elements; (4) semantics is totally maintained. At last, the ranks are summed and the overall maintained semantics is calculated.
The competency questions were responded as follows:

\textbf{CQ01.} In the original ontology (SSN), the main characteristics of the Vaisala WM30 sensor can be extracted by starting the navigation in the \textit{WM30:Vaisala\_WM30} element, which is a \textit{ssn:SensingDevice}, inheriting the properties from \textit{ssn:Device} and \textit{ssn:Sensor}. Besides, the \textit{rdfs:comment} with a general description of this wind sensor, it represents that the sensor is composed by two sensors (\textit{WM30:WM30\_WindDirection} and \textit{WM30:WM30\_WindSpeed)}, one for wind direction and another for wind speed (both \textit{ssn:Sensor}). Moreover, WM30 sensor can measure (observe) the types (properties) \textit{WM30:WindDirection} and \textit{WM30:WindSpeed} (both \textit{ssn:Property}). Figure \ref{fig:SSN_SystemProperties} illustrates these properties.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.98]{SSN_SystemProperties}
\caption{Vaisala WM30 \textit{Sensing Device}} (SSN)
\label{fig:SSN_SystemProperties}
\end{figure}

In the generated ontology (SAREF), according to M01, \textit{WM30:Vaisala\_WM30} element is created as a \textit{saref:Sensor}. A \textit{saref:SensingFunction} is created and the \textit{WM30:Vaisala\_WM30} element linked to it through \textit{saref:hasFunction} property. According to M02, the composition of the sensor \textit{WM30:Vaisala\_WM30} is derived from the \textit{ssn:hasSubSystem} properties, i.e. \textit{WM30:WM30\_WindDirection} and \textit{WM30:WM30\_WindSpeed}, as depict in Figure \ref{fig:SSN_SystemProperties}. M03 produced the measurement properties of the sensor from the \textit{ssn:observes element}, i.e. \textit{saref:measuresProperty} to \textit{WM30:WindDirection} and \textit{WM30:WindSpeed}. Figure \ref{fig:SSN_SystemProperties} illustrates the result \textit{WM30:Vaisala\_WM30)} as a \textit{saref:Sensor}. Therefore, by navigating to \textit{WM30:Vaisala_WM30} (\textit{saref:Sensor}) it is possible to respond this competency question in a similar way from the original, i.e. the semantics is completely maintained, ranked as 4.

\caption{Vaisala WM30 \textit{Sensing Device} (SAREF)}
\label{fig:SAREF_Sensor_WM30}

\textbf{CQ02.} In the original ontology (SSN), the composition of Vaisala WM30 sensor can be extracted by navigating from the \textit{WM30:Vaisala\_WM30} element to the \textit{ssn:hasSubSystem} properties, i.e. \textit{WM30:WM30\_WindDirection} and \textit{WM30:WM30\_WindSpeed}, both \textit{ssn:Sensor}. In particular, the WM30 wind direction sensor (\textit{WM30:WM30\_WindDirection}) can have one wiper (\textit{WM30:WMS301}) or two (\textit{WM30:WMS302}), which has greater measurement range. The same structure is generated in SAREF, resulted from M02, having \textit{WM30:WM30\_WindDirection} and \textit{WM30:WM30\_WindSpeed} created as \textit{saref:Device}, linked through the object property \textit{saref:consistsOf}. It is possible to achieve the same structure of \textit{WM30:WM30\_WindDirection} and \textit{WM30:WM30\_WindSpeed}, including the specialization to one or two wipes, by navigating from \textit{WM30:Vaisala\_WM30} (\textit{saref:Sensor}) through \textit{saref:consistsOf}. Therefore, this competency question is responded in a similar way from the original, i.e. the semantics is completely maintained, ranked as 4.

\textbf{CQ03.} In the original ontology (SSN), the measurement properties of Vaisala WM30 sensor can be extracted by navigating from the \textit{WM30:Vaisala\_WM30} element to the ssn:observes properties, i.e. \textit{WM30:WindDirection} and \textit{WM30:WindSpeed}, both \textit{ssn:Property}. WM30 original example also uses an ontology of Quantity Kinds (\url{http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/qu}) through the element \textit{qu:QuantityKind} as \textit{ssn:Property}. This element provides a taxonomy of quality dimensions, making use of \textit{dim:Angle} for \textit{WM30:WindDirection} and \textit{dim:VelocityOrSpeed} for \textit{WM30:WindSpeed}. The same structure is generated in SAREF, resulted from M03, as \textit{saref:Property}. Therefore, similar to CQ01 and CQ02, the semantics is completely maintained, ranked as 4.

\textbf{CQ04.} In the original ontology (SSN), ...
This question couldn't be responded with the generated ontology because there are no mappings from ssn:hasMeasurementCapability and this conceptualization  is a gap in SAREF.

\subsection{Discussion}

Some issues were detected in this example:
\\First, saref:Sensor provides subclasses that are types of sensors, as saref:SmokeSensor and saref:TemperatureSensor, which have the properties of saref:hasFunction and saref:measuresProperty, linking the type of the sensor with functions it has and the type of property it measures, in these cases saref:Smoke and saref:Temperature, respectively. The correct implementation for the wind sensor would create the subclass saref:WindSensor, with function sensing and measuring the properties of wind direction and wind speed. 


SSN: why ssn:Sensor is not a ssn:System? At first, the dc:source property of ssn:Sensor states that: “allows sensors, methods, instruments, systems, algorithms and process chains as the process used of an observation (…) they are all grouped under the term sensor”. Second, by having ssn:Sensor as sub class of ssn:System, it inherits the composition relationship (ssn:hasSubSystem) and, thus, can represent a set of sensors.
