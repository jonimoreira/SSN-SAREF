The ontology is intended as the basis for the semantic representa- tion of sensors and as the formal description for reasoning about sensors and observations. The paper describes the ontology, presents two exam- ple sensor descriptions and shows how standard reasoning and query- ing techniques can be used to perform tasks including classification and composition. In conjunction with the technical material the trade-offs required to express complex material in OWL is also discussed.},

@article{Ganzha2016,
abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) idea, explored across the globe, brings about an important issue: how to achieve interoperability among multiple existing (and constantly created) IoT platforms. In this context, in January 2016, the European Commission has funded seven projects that are to deal with various aspects of interoperability in the Internet of Things. Among them, the INTER-IoT project is aiming at the design and implementation of, and experimentation with, an open cross-layer framework and associated methodology to provide voluntary interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms. While the project considers interoperability across all layers of the software stack, we are particularly interested in answering the question: how ontologies and semantic data processing can be harnessed to facilitate interoperability across the IoT landscape. Henceforth, we have engaged in a "fact finding mission" to establish what is currently at our disposal when semantic interoperability is concerned. Since the INTER-IoT project is initially driven by two use cases originating from (i) (e/m). Health and (ii) . transportation and logistics, these two application domains were used to provide context for our search. The paper summarizes our findings and provides foundation for developing methods and tools for supporting semantic interoperability in the INTER-IoT project (and beyond).},

abstract="Despite the proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms for building and deploying IoT applications in the cloud, there is still no easy way to integrate heterogeneous geographically and administratively dispersed sensors and IoT services in a semantically interoperable fashion. In this paper we provide an overview of the OpenIoT project, which has developed and provided a first-of-kind open source IoT platform enabling the semantic interoperability of IoT services in the cloud. At the heart of OpenIoT lies the W3C Semantic Sensor Networks (SSN) ontology, which provides a common standards-based model for representing physical and virtual sensors. OpenIoT includes also sensor middleware that eases the collection of data from virtually any sensor, while at the same time ensuring their proper semantic annotation. Furthermore, it offers a wide range of visual tools that enable the development and deployment of IoT applications with almost zero programming. Another key feature of OpenIoT is its ability to handle mobile sensors, thereby enabling the emerging wave of mobile crowd sensing applications. OpenIoT is currently supported by an active community of IoT researchers, while being extensively used for the development of IoT applications in areas where semantic interoperability is a major concern.",
